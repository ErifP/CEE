            <tr>
                <td><br/>Chamomile tea - has some unique properties that may improve sleep quality. One study in 34 adults found those who consumed 270 mg of chamomile extract twice daily for 28 days fell asleep 15 minutes faster and experienced less night time wakening, compared to those who did not consume the extract.</td>
                
                <td>Alcohol - Contrary to popular belief alcohol does not help promote sleep. While it can make you drowsy and more likely to fall asleep faster, it often disrupts sleep and can deter you from entering the deeper, much needed phases of the sleep cycles.</td>

            <tr>
                <td><br/>Cherry Juice - In a small study, melatonin-rich tart cherry juice was shown to aid sleep. When adults with chronic insomnia drank a cup of tart cherry juice twice a day they experienced some relief in the severity of their insomnia.</td>
                <td><br/>Foods containing water such as watermelon and celery are natural diuretics which help push water through your system. Eating these types of foods and drinking anything too close to bedtime can cause you to lose sleep from middle of the night bathroom trips.</td>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><br/>Almonds - Contain high doses of melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate the sleeping and waking cycle. 1oz serving of whole almonds also contains 77 mg of magnesium and 76mg of calcium, two minerals that may help promote muscle relaxation and sleep.</td>
                <td><br/>Cheese - While cheese is meant to give you cheesy dreams, it is actually one of the worst foods to eat before bed. Strong or aged cheese contains naturally high levels of the amino acid, tyramine, which make us feel alert. Tyramine causes the adrenal gland to release the ‘fight or flight’ hormone, which increases alertness for a number of hours.</td>

            <tr>
                <td><br/>Kiwis - This green fruit may be the ultimate pre-bed snack. When volunteers ate two kiwis an hour before hitting the hay, they slept almost a full extra hour, found research from Taipei Medical University in Taiwan. Kiwis are full of vitamins C and E, serotonin and folate-all of which may help you snooze.</td>
                <td><br/>Caffeine - It's no surprise that an evening cup of coffee might disrupt your sleep. But don't forget about less obvious caffeine sources, like chocolate, cola, and tea. Even decaf coffee has a trace of it -- but not enough to be a problem. For better sleep, cut all caffeine from your diet 4 to 6 hours before bedtime.</td>
