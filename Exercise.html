>Exercise and Sleep
</h1>

<p>
    Scientific studies have shown that taking some exercise can help you sleep better at night.
</p>
    
<p>
    Stress and anxiety are a common cause of sleep problems, both in getting to sleep and staying asleep 
    during the night. Even small amounts of moderate exercise have been shown to reduce stress levels 
    and will help you sleep better at night.
</p>
    
<p>
    Being more active can help improve your sleep by:
</p>
    
<ul>
 <li>Improving the quality of your night’s sleep.</li>
 <li>You’ll spend longer in a deep sleep which is great for reducing stress and anxiety</li>
 <li>Helping you to sleep longer. Regular exercise makes you feel more tired at the end of the day.</li>
</ul>   
    
<p>
    Here are some top tips for exercising to improve your sleep:
</p>
   
<ul>
 <li>If you can, exercise outside. This is proven to relieve stress, tension and anxiety and getting more natural light reinforces your sleep-wake cycle.</li>
 <li>Try not to exercise an hour or two before bed as the natural endorphins produced by exercise may make it more difficult for you to go to sleep.</li>
 <li>Get familiar with your choronobiology. Tests like this one https://thepowerofwhenquiz.com/ can tell you your chronotype and advise you on what type of exercise would work best for you. </li>
 <li>Stick with it! It may take a few weeks for the effect to kick in so don’t get disheartened if you’re not sleeping better straight away. You’re doing yourself a favour by getting more exercise and the effect will start to kick in.
</ul>

  <p>
      The roll down warm up and cool down move is perfect for decompressing in the evening.  
      To start, stand tall with feet hips-width apart, hands against your sides. Shoulders are relaxed. 
      Using your abdominal muscles, slowly bend forward. Let arms dangle toward the floor and hang, 
      while you breathe deeply. Try to touch the ground and then hold the pose for a second or two. 
      Next, reverse and roll up slowly, keeping the abdominal muscles engaged.

  <p>
        Try "legs on a wall." Sit close to a wall. Lie on your back, push your bum close to the wall. 
        Lift your legs up and rest them against the wall. Put your arms by your sides and turn up your 
        palms. Hold that position for 10 to 20 seconds.
  </p>
 </div>

 <div id="exerciseExample2">

  <img src="./yoga2.jpg" title="yogaStretch" height="200px" class="center">

  <p>
        Sit on the floor with your legs together, flat, and outstretched in front of you. 
        Slowly bend your torso forward and reach for your toes. 
        Try to hold this hamstring stretch for up to 30 seconds.

  <p>
      While lying in bed, curl your toes on both feet and hold them in that position for a few seconds. 
      Then uncurl them so they're completely relaxed. Next, tense up your calf muscles in your legs 
      and hold them in that position for a few seconds. Then release them. 
      Follow that pattern and work your way up the body, tensing and relaxing different muscle groups. 
      There are so many muscles in the body that sometimes you may not even realize that you've spent 
      all day tensing, say, your shoulders—until you stop to think about your shoulders, specifically, 
      and release that tension.

    <p>
        Find a quiet room and dim the lights. Sitting in a comfortable position on the floor, 
        with your shoes removed, close your eyes. Breathe deeply—in through your nose and out through your 
        mouth—as you try to clear your mind of all thoughts.  Focus on your breath. 
        Doing this for 25 minutes per day is ideal, but even a few minutes of meditation is better 
        than nothing!
