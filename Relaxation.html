<h1>Relaxation Tips</h1>

<p>Winding down is an important part of getting ready for sleep. See our <a href="Routines.html">Routine Page</a> for more information.</p>
<!---put in real link above-->

<p>There are many ways to do this, but here are a few ideas and tips to get you started:</p>

<ul>
<li>Try to avoid using electronic devices such as smartphones and tablets for about an hour before you go to bed as the light from these devices may have a negative effect on sleep</li>
<li>Using one of the many apps available to aid sleep (see our technology page)</li>
<li>A warm bath or shower (not too hot) can help get your body to an ideal temperature for resting</li>
<li>Writing down any concerns or tasks for the following day can help organise your thoughts and clear your mind of any distractions</li>
<li>If you find your mind is focussing on distracting thoughts you can try doing a mental puzzle, repeating words (such as counting sheep), or focussing on other images or thoughts. These are part of a technique called thought blocking and can be part of a more structured programme to help with insomnia, further information <a href="https://www.sleepstation.org.uk/articles/sleep-tips/thought-blocking/">here</a></li>
<li>Light stretching or relaxation exercise, such as some non-strenuous yoga, can help to relax the muscles. Do not do anything too vigorous however, as this can have a negative effect (see our <a href="Exercise.html">Exercise Page</a>)</li>
<li>Meditation and breathing exercises can be very useful. Audio guidance can be found on apps, CDs and online if you don’t have any existing techniques</li> 
<li>Reading or listening to an audiobook or the radio can relax the mind through distraction</li>
<li>Avoid caffeine and tobacco in the evenings – these are both stimulants and can keep you awake</li>
<li>Do not over indulge in food and alcohol before bed (see our <a href="Diet.html">Diet Page</a>)</li>
<li>Try using your bed just for sleeping and sexual activity – this makes you associate going to bed with sleeping and relaxing</li>
<li>Create a positive sleeping environment:</li>
    <li>Keep your bed clean, tidy and comfortable</li>
    <li>Ensure you are not too hot or cold in bed – make sure you have adequate blankets and your heating is not set too high for your comfort</li>
    <li>Ensure there are no lights that distract or wake you – think about whether your curtains are blocking enough light in the morning if the sunrise disturbs your sleep</li>
    <li>Try to prevent any noises or night time disturbances (where possible) – ear plugs can be helpful when noises are unavoidable (for example traffic or neighbours)</li>
</ul>
