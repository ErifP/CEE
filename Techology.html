    Technology - Good or Bad?
</h1>
    
    <p>
        The use of technology can impact your sleep in both positive and negative ways.
    </p>
       
<h2>
    The Negatives
</h2>        
<h3>
        Supressing Melatonin
</h3>
    <p>
        The screens of moblie phones, tablets, computers and TVs emit blue light which reduces the production 
        of melatonin. This hormone helps to control your sleep/wake cycle so reducing the levels of melatonin in the 
        body can make it harder to fall asleep and stay asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
        Make sure you allow at least thrity minutes without a screen before going to sleep.  
    </p>
    <p>
        We suggest making your bedroom a gadget-free zone to remove the temptation!
    </p>

<h3>
        Keeping Your Brain Alert
</h3>
    <p>
        Surfing the internet or watching TV before bed can trick your brain into thinking it needs to stay
        awake. Maybe watching an exciting movie or looking at photos on social media can make it harder to
        relax and settle down to sleep.
    </p>   
    <p> 
        Your brain needs a rest - particularly if you've been looking at a screen all day!
    </p>    
    
<h3>
        They Wake You Up.
</h3>
    <p>
        Keeping a mobile phone or tablet by your bed can wake you up in the night thanks to late-night 
        texts, emails, calls, or calendar reminders. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Almost two-thirds of children aged between six to 17 sleep with at least one electronic device 
        in their bedroom, which leads to them getting less sleep on school nights compared with other kids, 
        according to their parents. This can add up to almost an hour per night, and the quality of
        this sleep is negatively affected too. 
    </p>    
    <p>
        To get a better night’s slumber, parents can limit their kids’ technology use in the bedroom, 
        and parent should set a good example by doing the same!
    </p>
    
<h2>
        The Positives
</h2>        
<p>
    There are many apps and products on the market which can be exceedingly helpful to get you into good sleep
    routines, help you monitor your nights and leave you feeling rested in the morning.
</p>        

<h3>
    The Apps
</h3>

 <h4>
    Noisli
</h4>    
<p>
    This super simple app lets you choose from a bunch of different sounds 
    (like thunder, wind, white noise, and even the buzz of a coffee shop) 
    to create your ideal sleep soundtrack. You can create a combo of sounds you love that you can 
    save in the app for future use. Pro tip: If you're using it overnight, keep your phone plugged
    in—otherwise, you may wake up to a dead battery.
</p>

<h4>
    Pzizz
</h4>
<p>
    With Pzizz, you can set a timer for the length of sleep session so it plays a soothing dreamscape 
    (read: combo of music, voiceovers, and sound effects) while you snooze; then, you can wake up to the 
    built-in alarm. You'll need to upgrade for more advanced features, like the ability to choose
    different sounds, but the app offers a seven-day free trial.
</p>
    
<h4>
    Slumber 
</h4>
<p>
    Slumber offers a combination of experiences to help you fall asleep, whether it's meditation focused, 
    a six-part bedtime story series, or the sound of a warm jacuzzi. You can also choose a background 
    noise (like rain or the ocean) to play for up to 10 hours after the main track ends. 
    New sleep-inducing stories and meditations are added each week, and you can listen to them all if 
    you upgrade to the premium version (otherwise, you can get many episodes for free).
</p>
<h4>
    Calm
</h4>
<p>
    Calm's app is super easy to use, and the Sleep Stories section has bedtime stories 
    (for kids and adults!) read aloud by people with soothing voices, including celebrities like 
    Matthew McConaughey. Only a few stories are included for free, but getting a subscription unlocks a 
    huge library of meditations made specifically for sleep — plus categories like stress and ASMR!    
</p>
<h4>
    Sleep Cycle App
</h4>
<p>
    If you want to learn how you slept, the Sleep Cycle app is for you. It tracks your sleep patterns 
    and provides tips to optimize your snooze time. Plus, it has a an alarm clock that gently wakes you 
    up when you're in your lightest sleep phase so you'll wake up feeling refreshed. Just keep in mind 
    that no sleep tracker is 100 percent accurate so if you're really struggling with your sleep, you may 
    need to see a dedicated sleep specialist.

    The Products
</h3>

<h4>
    Dowdow Sleep Machine
</h4>
<p>
    Falling asleep can be the hardest part, but teaching yourself to get better at it is now easier 
    than ever. Thanks, technology! The sleep aid device Dodow is a metronome combined with a light system 
    that trains your body to naturally fall asleep with ease. With guided breathing exercises that slow 
    your metabolism and reduce your flow of thoughts, you’ll find yourself dozing off in no time. 
    Dodow claims someone who normally takes 60 minutes to fall asleep will take no more than 25 with the 
    device, gaining around 100 additional hours of sleep annually.

<h4>
    SomniLight Red LED Night Light
</h4>
    <p>
    Surprisingly enough, red has proven to be the most productive color for a sound sleep. 
    Though the color isn't know for being soothing (especially for those of us who've run our fair 
    share of red lights), research has proven it can help you fall asleep and stay asleep.     
</p>   
<h4>
    Cirlce Home
</h4>
<p>    
    Can’t sleep because you’re scrolling through Instagram? You’re not alone.

<h4></h4>
    Bose Noise-Masking Sleep Buds
</h4>
<p>
    These wireless earbuds, which we awarded one of our top earplugs for sleep, will block out noise, 
    so you can have an uninterrupted sleep. Instead of streaming music, the earbuds play soothing sounds 
    to cover up unwanted outside noise, helping you not only fall asleep, but also stay asleep. 
    They’re really comfortable and stay in your ears all night, even if you sleep on your side. 
    You can also set wake-up alarms that only you can hear, so you won’t disturb the person sleeping 
    next to you.     
</p>    
<h4>
    Philips Somneo Sleep & Wake-Up light
</h4>
<p>
    It’s our body’s natural response to wake up with the sun, and these alarm clocks help you to do 
    just that. “Nobody enjoys being shocked out of a deep sleep by the shriek of standard alarm clock, 
    and clocks like this are the perfect remedy for that,” Bill Fish, a Certified Sleep Science Coach and 
    co-founder of Tuck, says. “You aren’t being jolted out of a deep sleep, which tend to make people 
    feel groggy,” he explains.
