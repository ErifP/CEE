    Technology - Good or Bad?

    <p>
        The use of technology can impact your sleep in both positive and negative ways.

<h2>
        Supressing Melatonin
</h2>
    <p>
        The screens of moblie phones, tablets, computers and TVs emit blue light which reduces the 
        production of melatonin. This hormone helps to control your sleep/wake cycle so reducing the
         levels of melatonin in the body can make it harder to fall asleep and stay asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
        Make sure you allow at least thrity minutes without a screen before going to sleep.  
    </p>
    <p>
        We suggest making your bedroom a gadget-free zone to remove the temptation!
    </p>

<h2>
        Keeping Your Brain Alert
</h2>
    <p>
        Surfing the internet or watching TV before bed can trick your brain into thinking it needs to stay
        awake. Maybe watching an exciting movie or looking at photos on social media can make it harder to
        relax and settle down to sleep.
    </p>   
    <p> 
        Your brain needs a rest - particularly if you've been looking at a screen all day!
    </p>    
    
<h2>
        They Wake You Up.
</h2>
    <p>
        Keeping a mobile phone or tablet by your bed can wake you up in the night thanks to late-night 
        texts, emails, calls, or calendar reminders. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Almost two-thirds of children aged between six to 17 sleep with at least one electronic device 
        in their bedroom, which leads to them getting less sleep on school nights compared with other kids, 
        according to their parents. This can add up to almost an hour per night, and the quality of
        this sleep is negatively affected too. 
    </p>    
    <p>
        To get a better night’s slumber, parents can limit their kids’ technology use in the bedroom, 
        and parent should set a good example by doing the same!
